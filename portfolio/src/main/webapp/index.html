        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>I am a rising junior at Duke University and a STEP
        software engineering intern at Google.
        I am interested in software engineering and product management.</p>
        <!-- A picture of myself. -->

        <p>This is me!</p>
        <p>I grew up in South Carolina but I also lived in Costa Rica for five years.
          I am second-generation immigrant; 
          I was born in the United States but my biological parents are from Costa Rica. 
          Growing up in rural South Carolina as a first-generation, low-income student 
          presented many challenges. Namely, a lack of resources and opportunities was a 
          huge issue. I didn't have access to any computer 
          science courses nor any advanced college-level courses. I self-taught AP Computer 
          Science A through an online course provided through SC's Department of Education 
          and I was able to get college credit for my first ever computer sciencd course. 
          Teaching myself how to program in Java was a challenging, yet rewarding experience 
          and it was then that I realized that I wanted to pursue a degree and career in 
          a technology-related field. Through hard-work and dedication, I was able to graduate 
          from my high-school as valedictorian.</p>  
        <!-- A picture of home: my backyard. -->

          alt="Photo of home" 
          class="image-container"/>
        <p>I received a full-scholarship to attend Duke University through the David M. 
          Rubenstein Scholarship, a program designed to give support to promising 
          first-generation college students. It was through this program that the 
          floodgates of opportunity opened up for me. Through Duke's resources and the 
          support I got from peers and mentors,I began to learn so much about the 
          possibilities available in the tech industry. I was able to take courses in 
          which I worked for a tech-startup based in Durham and the Department of Defense, 
          both invaluable experiences. Last summer, I was also able to participate 
          in Code+, a Duke Office of Information of Technology-operated program designed 
          for students new to the tech industry, with an emphasis on groups who are 
          traditionally underrepresented. I feel truly blessed to have been given so many 
          opportunities and I am thankful to all the people who've helped me along the way. 
          Now, I feel even more blessed that I get to intern at one of most amazing tech 
          companies in the world: Google. Although the circumstances may not be ideal, I want 
          to make the most of the experience and learn as much as I can and connect with
          even more amazing people.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Jetson Nano OpenCV Security</h3>
        <img src="/images/Jetson_Nano_.jpg" 
          alt="Jetson Nano, a small computer with a built-in GPU" 
          class="image-container"/>
        <p> Through a team-based internship sponsored by Duke called Code+, I worked with 
          three other interns to developed a facial recognition application. 
          We used OpenCV and Dlib models as well as a server running on Gunicorn and Flask 
          for our application. A Jeston Nano is essentialy a small, inexpensive Linux machine 
          like a Rasberry Pi that has a built-in 
          GPU and can be run headless. We designed an IOT device from an Nvidia Jetson Nano,
          a Pi-Cam, and a case to store the components and created a deployable unit.  
          Our program could remotely unlock doors based on whether an authorized person was 
          detected. We harnessed a low-cost, low-powered, embedded solution that could be 
          implemented on the edge of Duke's network. Rather dealing with the latency and 
          security issues associated with sending frame buffers to a server for computation, 
          all computer vision computations were done on-device. We tested on devices such as a 
          Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano and found that the Jetson Nano was actually more 
          cost-effective given its performance increase per dollar over the Raspberry Pi with a 
          Neural Compute Stick. We made various presentations to stakeholders throughout the 
          project and delivered a final demo at a poster session.</p>
        <h3>+DataScience in Medicine Research</h3>
        <img src="/images/thyroid.jpg" 
          alt="Thyroid cells under a microscope" 
          class="image-container"/>
        <p>In a small research team, we harnessed convolutional neural networks and transfer 
          learning to predict the incidence of thyroid cancer and malignancy probability. We 
          worked on finding ways to increase the accuracy and efficiency of our Pytorch models. 
          One method we explored was using the three-dimensionality of cells to our advantage. 
          For each 'slide' in our database of thyroid-cell images, there were multiple 
          versions of that slide at set "depths" in which certain parts of the image would be more
          in focus than in others. Using this fact, I developed an autofocus algorithm using a 
          gaussian filter and variance to increase algorithm accuracy by using the most "sharpened" 
          depth of a particular thyroid-cell slide, which was then fed into our classifier after 
          it had been trained. We used Duke's massive GPU Computer Cluster to train our models in 
          the interest of time. Throughout this project, we made multiple presentations, culminating 
          in a final poster session.</p>

        <h3>The Gym</h3>
        <img src="/images/workout.jpg" 
          alt="The Gym" 
          class="image-container"/>
        <p>Weightlifting is one of my hobbies; therefore, the gym is one of my favorite 
          places to go to. I enjoy working out and pushing myself to improve each time 
          I go to the gym. Although sometimes I may lack the motivation, I always come 
          out of the gym feeling good knowing that I had accomplished something that 
          will inevitably improve my health and well-being. Going with my friends motivates 
          me a lot as we can push each other and hold each other accountable.
          When I put 250 pounds on my back and perform squats, I feel powerful and motivated 
          to succeed in other endeavors.</p>
        <h3>Duke University</h3>
        <img src="/images/Duke.JPG" 
          alt="Duke's Campus" 
          class="image-container"/>
        <p>Duke University's campus is one of my favorite places on Earth. Duke feels like a 
          completely different place, as if it is in its own bubble. The architecture is majestic 
          and truly breathtaking. The facilities are packed with resources: I have access to over 
          40 local restaurants on campus alone, two enormous gym facilities, countless places to 
          study, multiple libraries, about a dozen graduate and professional schools, and world-class 
          professors. Although the overwhelming amount of resources available 
          to is a huge draw, I feel like the people is what makes Duke such a great place. 
          I've made so many amazing friends throughout my two years there and I have made so 
          many valuable connections along the way. It's like home away from home.</p>

        <h3>Speedcubing</h3>
        <img src="/images/cube-3x3x3.jpg" 
          alt="3 by 3 by 3 Rubik's Cube" 
          class="image-container">
        <p>When I was younger, I always thought of the Rubik's cube as an enigma, 
          easy to pick up, impossible to solve. However, once I set
          out to teach my self how to solve the Rubik's cube, I realized how 
          simple and logical it really was. A Rubik's cube can be solved in
          a series of steps called algorithms, which are essentially combinations 
          of moves or turns that must be performed when the cube is
          aligned or oriented in a certain way. I quickly grew to love it and 
          eventually bought a speedcube, which is made for fast, smooth
          turns in comparison to the standard Rubik's cube. Once I had learned 
          the basic algorithms and could solve a Rubik's cube within 1.5
          minutes, I decided to learn a speedsolving method. There are hundreds 
          of speedsolving methods ranging from bottom-up, top-down,
          corners-first, edges-first, columns-first, etc. Each has their 
          own unique strenghts and weaknesses. On my next post, I will talk about 
          the Fridrich method, also known as CFOP, one of the most famous bottom-up 
          speedsolving methods.</p>
        <h3>CFOP/Fridrich Method</h3>
        <img src="/images/speedcube.jpg" 
          alt="3 by 3 by 3 Speedcube" 
          class="image-container">
        <p>The Fridrich Method is one of the most prolific speedsolving 
          methods for 3x3x3 Rubik's cubes. Also known as CFOP, it is a bottom-up 
          method of speedsolving Rubik's cubes. This method takes advantage of 
          initially setting up a cross (the C in CFOP) on any face of a 
          cube and then procededing to solve the cube with that face facing 
          downward. Throught the entire solve, this face remains facing downward. 
          Once the cross has been formed, when can proceed with the F in CFOP, 
          which actually stands for First Two Layers (F2L).
          F2L can be performed either intuitively or with algorithms. I generally 
          tend to use a combination of intuition and algorithms when solving 
          F2L as there can be dozens of situations in a given solve. The first 
          two layers of a Rubik's cube are able to be solved simultaneously because 
          you can easily connect a bottom corner and it's associated edge without 
          having to worry about messing up the rest of the solve. Once F2L 
          has been completed, we must orient the the last layer (the top layer 
          of the cube). This is known as OLL and is the O in CFOP. Orienting the 
          last layer consists of two steps: forming a cross on the top, and then 
          using one of a selection of algorithms to get every color on the top the 
          same. If the top of the last layer is yellow, then we want the yellow-face 
          to be completely yellow.Once the last layer has been oriented correctly, 
          we need to permute it. This is known a PLL (Permute Last Layer) or the P in CFOP. 
          Permuting the last layer involves positioning all of the 1x1x1 cubes in 
          the top layer so that they are placed in their correct position. 
          There are a variety of algorithms that can be used depending on how 
          these cubes were oriented previously, and once a single algorithm is 
          performed with the correct orientation, the Rubik's cube is solved. Learning 
          CFOP takes a lot of practice and muscle memory and getting faster involves strategy 
          and learning new algorithms to optimize your average solve time.</p>
        <h3>Solving 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes</h3>
        <img src="/images/cube-5x5x5.jpg" 
        alt="5 by 5 by 5 Rubik's Cube" 
        class="image-container">
        <p>The basic methods for solving 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 Rubik's cubes are extremely
          similar to solving 3x3x3 cubes. Solving Rubik's cubes with dimensions greater
          than 3x3x3 usually amounts to "creating" edges and centers that allow these 
          high-numbered cubes to function as a 3x3x3 cube. Firstly, all the centers of 
          a jumbled 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 cube must be formed using predetermined algorithms so 
          that what remains are edges and corners. Afterwards, the edges must be joined to 
          form double-edges, triple-edges, etc. by matching edges of the same colors into 
          a single super-edge, this again is done through the use of an algorithm. 
          Once these centers and super-edges are formed, the cube can then be solved using 
          your 3x3x3 method of choice. Parity issues occur when a high-numbered cube
          is solved completely, with all 1x1x1 cuboids in their correct position but one 
          or more of these cuboids is oriented incorrectly. Parity issues are solved
          through a series of long algorithms, but are usually more prevalent and harder 
          to correct in even-numbered cubes like the 4x4x4. This occurs because
          even-numbered cubes do not have a literal 1x1x1 "center" on each of their faces 
          unlike odd-numbered cubes like the 5x5x5. Special parity issues occur with 
          even-numbered cubes as a result.</p>
