        <h3>Jetson Nano OpenCV Security</h3>
        <img src="/images/Jetson_Nano_.jpg" 
          alt="Jetson Nano, a small computer with a built-in GPU" 
          class="image-container"/>
        <p> Through a team-based internship sponsored by Duke called Code+, 
          I worked with three other interns to developed a facial 
          recognition application. We used OpenCV and Dlib models as well 
          as a server running on Gunicorn and Flask for our application. 
          A Jeston Nano is essentialy a small, inexpensive Linux machine 
          like a Rasberry Pi that has a built-in GPU and can be run headless. 
          We designed an IOT device from an Nvidia Jetson Nano,
          a Pi-Cam, and a case to store the components and created a 
          deployable unit. Our program could remotely unlock doors based 
          on whether an authorized person was detected. We harnessed a 
          low-cost, low-powered, embedded solution that could be 
          implemented on the edge of Duke's network. Rather dealing 
          with the latency and security issues associated with sending 
          frame buffers to a server for computation, all computer vision 
          computations were done on-device. We tested on devices such as a 
          Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano and found that the Jetson Nano was 
          actually more cost-effective given its performance increase 
          per dollar over the Raspberry Pi with a Neural Compute Stick. 
          We made various presentations to stakeholders throughout the 
          project and delivered a final demo at a poster session.</p>
        <h3>+DataScience in Medicine Research</h3>
        <img src="/images/thyroid.jpg" 
          alt="Thyroid cells under a microscope" 
          class="image-container"/>
        <p>In a small research team, we harnessed convolutional neural 
          networks and transfer learning to predict the incidence of 
          thyroid cancer and malignancy probability. We 
          worked on finding ways to increase the accuracy and efficiency
          of our Pytorch models. One method we explored was using the 
          three-dimensionality of cells to our advantage. 
          For each 'slide' in our database of thyroid-cell images, 
          there were multiple versions of that slide at set "depths" 
          in which certain parts of the image would be more
          in focus than in others. Using this fact, I developed an 
          autofocus algorithm using a gaussian filter and variance to 
          increase algorithm accuracy by using the most "sharpened" 
          depth of a particular thyroid-cell slide, which was then 
          fed into our classifier after it had been trained. We used 
          Duke's massive GPU Computer Cluster to train our models in 
          the interest of time. Throughout this project, we made 
          multiple presentations, culminating in a final poster session.</p>

          class="image-container"/>
        <p>Weightlifting is one of my hobbies; therefore, the gym 
          is one of my favorite places to go to. I enjoy working 
          out and pushing myself to improve each time 
          I go to the gym.  
          I always come out of the gym feeling good knowing that I had 
          accomplished something that will inevitably improve my health 
          and well-being. Going with my friends motivates 
          me a lot as we can push each other and hold each other accountable.

        <p>Duke University's campus is one of my favorite places on Earth. 
          Duke feels like a completely different place, as if it is in its 
          own bubble. The architecture is majestic and truly breathtaking. 
          Although the 
          overwhelming amount of resources available to me is a huge draw, I feel 
          like the people is what makes Duke such a great place. 
          I've made so many amazing friends throughout my two years there and 
          I have made so many valuable connections along the way. It's like 
          home away from home.</p>

        <h3>Speedcubing</h3>
        <img src="/images/speedcube.jpg" 
          alt="3 by 3 by 3 Speedcube" 
          class="image-container">
        <p>When I was younger, I always thought of the Rubik's cube as an 
          enigma, easy to pick up, impossible to solve. However, once I set
          out to teach my self how to solve the Rubik's cube, I realized how 
          simple and logical it really was. A Rubik's cube can be solved in
          a series of steps called algorithms, which are essentially 
          combinations of moves or turns that must be performed when the 
          cube is aligned or oriented in a certain way. I quickly grew to 
          love it and eventually bought a speedcube, which is made for fast, 
          smooth turns in comparison to the standard Rubik's cube. Once I had 
          learned the basic algorithms and could solve a Rubik's cube within 
          1.5 minutes, I decided to learn a speedsolving method. There are 
          hundreds of speedsolving methods ranging from bottom-up, top-down,
          corners-first, edges-first, columns-first, etc. Each has their 
          own unique strenghts and weaknesses. On my next post, I will 
          talk about the Fridrich method, also known as CFOP, one of the most 
          famous bottom-up speedsolving methods.</p>
        <h3>CFOP/Fridrich Method</h3>
        <p>The Fridrich Method is one of the most prolific speedsolving 
          methods for 3x3x3 Rubik's cubes. Also known as CFOP, it is a 
          bottom-up method of speedsolving Rubik's cubes. This method 
          takes advantage of initially setting up a cross (the C in CFOP) 
          on any face of a cube and then procededing to solve the cube 
          with that face facing downward. Throught the entire solve, 
          this face remains facing downward. 
          Once the cross has been formed, when can proceed with the F in CFOP, 
          which actually stands for First Two Layers (F2L).
          F2L can be performed either intuitively or with algorithms. 
          I generally tend to use a combination of intuition and algorithms 
          when solving F2L as there can be dozens of situations in a given 
          solve. The first two layers of a Rubik's cube are able to be solved
          simultaneously because you can easily connect a bottom corner and 
          it's associated edge without having to worry about messing up the 
          rest of the solve. Once F2L has been completed, we must orient the 
          the last layer (the top layer of the cube). This is known as OLL 
          and is the O in CFOP. Orienting the last layer consists of two steps: 
          forming a cross on the top, and then using one of a selection of 
          algorithms to get every color on the top the same. If the top of 
          the last layer is yellow, then we want the yellow-face 
          to be completely yellow.Once the last layer has been oriented 
          correctly, we need to permute it. This is known a PLL 
          (Permute Last Layer) or the P in CFOP. Permuting the last layer 
          involves positioning all of the 1x1x1 cubes in 
          the top layer so that they are placed in their correct position. 
          There are a variety of algorithms that can be used depending on how 
          these cubes were oriented previously, and once a single algorithm is 
          performed with the correct orientation, the Rubik's cube is solved. 
          Learning CFOP takes a lot of practice and muscle memory and 
          getting faster involves strategy and learning new algorithms 
          to optimize your average solve time.</p>
