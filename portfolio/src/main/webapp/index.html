        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Jetson Nano OpenCV Security</h3>
        <p>Developed a facial recognition application using OpenCV and Dlib to be used as an extra layer of physical security. Our program could remotely unlock doors based on whether an authorized person was detected
        Harnessed low-cost, low-powered, embedded solution that could be implemented on the edge of a network
        Tested on devices such as Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano; made various presentations to stakeholders throughout</p>
        <h3>+DataScience in Medicine Research</h3>
        <p>Harnessed Pytorch models using transfer learning for thyroid cancer prediction and malignancy probability
        Developed an autofocus algorithm using a gaussian filter and variance to increase algorithm accuracy/p>
        <h3>Workout Tracking iOS App</h3>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Places</h2>
        <h3>The Gym</h3>
        <img src="/images/workout.jpg" alt="The Gym" class="image-container" >
        <p>Weightlifting is one of my hobbies; therefore, the gym is one of my favorite places to go to.
          I enjoy working out and pushing myself to improve each time I go to the gym. 
          Although sometimes I may lack the motivation, I always come out of the gym feeling good 
          knowing that I had accomplished something that will inevitably improve my health and well-being. 
          Going with my friends motivates me a lot as we can push each other and hold each other accountable.
          When I put 250 pounds on my back and perform squats, I feel powerful and motivated to succeed in other endeavors.</p>
        <h3>Duke University</h3>
        <img src="/images/Duke.JPG" alt="Duke's Campus" class="image-container">
        <p>Duke University's campus is one of my favorite places on Earth. Duke feels like a completely different place, as if
          it is in its own bubble. The architecture is majestic and truly breathtaking. The facilities are packed with resources:
          I have access to over 40 local restaurants on campus alone, two enormous gym facilities, countless places to study,
          multiple libraries, about a dozen graduate and professional schools, and world-class professors. Although the overwhelming
          amount of resources available to is a huge draw, I feel like the people is what makes Duke such a great place. I've made so 
          many amazing friends throughout my two years there and I have made so many valuable connections along the way. 
          It's like home away from home.</p>

        <h3>Speedcubing</h3>
        <p>When I was younger, I always thought of the Rubik's cube as an enigma, easy to pick up, impossible to solve. However, once I set
          out to teach my self how to solve the Rubik's cube, I realized how simple and logical it really was. A Rubik's cube can be solved in
          a series of steps called algorithms, which are essentially combinations of moves or turns that must be performed when the cube is
          aligned or oriented in a certain way. I quickly grew to love it and eventually bought a speedcube, which is made for fast, smooth
          turns in comparison to the standard Rubik's cube. Once I had learned the basic algorithms and could solve a Rubik's cube within 1.5
          minutes, I decided to learn a speedsolving method. There are hundreds of speedsolving methods ranging from bottom-up, top-down,
          corners-first, edges-first, columns-first, etc. Each has their own unique strenghts and weaknesses. On my next post, I will talk about 
          the Fridrich method, also known as CFOP, one of the most famous bottom-up speedsolving methods.</p>
        <h3>CFOP/Fridrich Method</h3>
        <p>The Fridrich Method is one of the most prolific speedsolving methods for 3x3x3 Rubik's cubes.</p>
        <h3>Solving 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes</h3>
        <p>The basic methods for solving 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 Rubik's cubes are extremely similar to solving 3x3x3 cubes.</p>
