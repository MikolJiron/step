          <h2>Places</h2>
          <h3>The Gym</h3>
          <img src="/images/workout.jpg" alt="The Gym" class="image-container" >
          <p>Weightlifting is one of my hobbies; therefore, the gym is one of my favorite places to go to.
              I enjoy working out and pushing myself to improve each time I go to the gym. 
              Although sometimes I may lack the motivation, I always come out of the gym feeling good 
              knowing that I had accomplished something that will inevitably improve my health and well-being. 
              Going with my friends motivates me a lot as we can push each other and hold each other accountable.
              When I put 250 pounds on my back and perform squats, I feel powerful and motivated to succeed in other endeavors. 
              Weightlifting truly is one the coolest things that I used to do. Now that the coronavirus has basically cut off 
              any access that I may have to a gym, given my remote location, it has unfortunately been a couple months since the
              last time I lifted. I sorely miss it.</p>
          <h3>Duke University</h3>
          <img src="/images/Duke.JPG" alt="Duke's Campus" class="image-container">
          <p>Duke University's campus is one of my favorite places on Earth. Duke feels like a completely different place, as if
              it is in its own bubble. The architecture is majestic and truly breathtaking. The facilities are packed with resources:
              I have access to over 40 local restaurants on campus alone, two enormous gym facilities, countless places to study,
              multiple libraries, about a dozen graduate and professional schools, and world-class professors. Although the overwhelming
              amount of resources available to is a huge draw, I feel like the people is what makes Duke such a great place. I've made so 
              many amazing friends throughout my two years there and I have met so many valuable connections along the way. 
              It's like home away from home.</p>
